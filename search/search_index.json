It provides businesses with the benefits of blockchain technology, including decentralization, immutability, and transparency, while reducing the costs and complexity associated with building and managing a blockchain infrastructure."},{"location":"#features","title":"Features","text":"<p>Features of Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) Product:</p>  1) Scalability: BaaS products provide scalability to businesses, allowing them to easily scale their blockchain applications as per their needs. This is particularly useful for businesses that experience spikes in demand, as it allows them to easily increase their blockchain capacity.   2) Security: BaaS products provide advanced security features, including end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, and tamper-proof storage of data, ensuring that data stored on the blockchain is secure and cannot be altered or tampered with.   3) Customizable: BaaS products allow businesses to customize their blockchain applications to meet their specific needs. This allows businesses to tailor their applications to their specific use cases, rather than having to use a one-size-fits-all solution.   4) Cost-effective: BaaS products are cost-effective, as they eliminate the need for businesses to build and maintain their own blockchain infrastructure. This saves businesses the significant costs associated with building and managing their own blockchain infrastructure.   5) Accessibility: BaaS products are easily accessible to businesses, as they are cloud-based and can be accessed from anywhere. This makes it easy for businesses to collaborate and share data securely with their partners and customers."},{"location":"#advantages","title":"Advantages","text":"<p>Advantages of Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) Product:</p>  1) Reduced complexity: BaaS products simplify the process of building and deploying blockchain applications, making it easier for businesses to adopt blockchain technology without requiring significant technical expertise.   2) Lower costs: BaaS products reduce the costs associated with building and maintaining a blockchain infrastructure, as businesses only pay for the services they use. This makes it easier for businesses to adopt blockchain technology without incurring significant upfront costs.   3) Faster deployment: BaaS products enable businesses to quickly deploy their blockchain applications, as they do not need to build and configure their own infrastructure. This allows businesses to take advantage of the benefits of blockchain technology without having to wait for their infrastructure to be set up.   4) Improved collaboration: BaaS products facilitate collaboration between businesses, as they provide a secure and transparent platform for sharing data and conducting transactions. This makes it easier for businesses to collaborate with their partners and customers, improving overall efficiency and productivity.   5) Increased transparency: BaaS products provide increased transparency, as all transactions on the blockchain are recorded and cannot be altered. This makes it easier for businesses to track and manage their transactions, improving overall transparency and accountability."},{"location":"apiref/","title":"BaaS API Documentation","text":"<p>Blockchain-as-a-Service APIs to build hyperledger fabric network on kubernetes environment.</p>"},{"location":"apiref/#deploy-orderer","title":"Deploy Orderer","text":"<p>API</p> <p>{{phase2-api-aws}}/api/deploy/orderer</p> <p>Authorization - Bearer Token</p> <p>Request</p> <pre><code>POST /api/deploy/orderer HTTP/1.1\nHost: {{beast-dev-baasapi}}\nContent-Length: 220\n\n{\n    \"orgName\": \"beast-ordorg\",\n    \"count\": 3,\n    \"maxMessageCount\": 10,\n    \"absoluteMaxBytes\": 103809024,\n    \"preferredMaxBytes\": 524288,\n    \"channelName\": \"system-channel\",\n    \"domain\": \"urusbeast.com\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Response</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"code\": 200,\n    \"success\": true,\n    \"message\": \"Orderer Service beast-ordorg created successfully with UID jerhe\",\n    \"data\": \"jerhe\"\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"apiref/#deploy-fabric-ca","title":"Deploy Fabric CA","text":"<p>API</p> <p>{{phase2-api-aws}}/api/deploy/fabric-ica</p> <p>Request</p> <pre><code>POST /api/deploy/fabric-ica HTTP/1.1\nHost: {{phase2-api-aws}}\nContent-Length: 68\n\n{\n    \"orgName\": \"org-hospitala\",\n    \"domain\": \"example.com\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Response</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"code\": 200,\n    \"success\": true,\n    \"message\": \"ICA for org org-hospitala deployed: Running\",\n    \"data\": null\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"apiref/#_1","title":"BaaS API Documentation","text":""},{"location":"hlf/","title":"About Hyperledger Fabric","text":"Hyperledger Fabric is an open source enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform, designed for use in enterprise contexts, that delivers some key differentiating capabilities  over other popular distributed ledger or blockchain platforms.   Fabric has a highly modular and configurable architecture, enabling innovation, versatility and optimization for a broad range of industry use cases including banking, finance, insurance, healthcare, human resources, supply chain and even digital music delivery.   The Fabric platform is also permissioned, meaning that, unlike with a public permissionless network, the participants are known to each other, rather than anonymous and therefore fully untrusted. This means that while the participants may not fully trust one another (they may, for example, be competitors in the same industry), a network can be operated under a governance model that is built off of what trust does exist between participants, such as a legal agreement or framework for handling disputes."},{"location":"hlf/#know-more-about-fabric","title":"Know More about Fabric","text":"<p>Official hyperledger fabric documentation - https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whatis.html</p> <p>Concepts in HLF - https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/key_concepts.html</p> <p>Install Fabric binaries and fabric-samples repo - https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html</p> <p>To play with fabric test network - https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html</p> <p>Commands Reference - https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html</p> <p>Architecture Reference - https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture.html</p>"}]}
